Scientific Name: Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis.

Description: A popular leafy vegetable characterized by its crisp, white stalks and smooth, dark green leaves. It is a type of Chinese cabbage that does not form a head. It grows quickly and is a staple in Filipino soups like nilaga and bulalo because it adds a fresh, crunchy texture and a mild, peppery sweetness.

17.![Musa_spp _1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8be3b642-3195-42d5-98e4-eb39cfcf6e60)
Common Name: Saging (also known as Banana).

Scientific Name: Musa sapientum (common varieties) or Musa acuminata.

Description: A large, herbaceous perennial plant that grows from an underground corm. Despite its size, it is technically an herb, not a tree, because its "trunk" is a pseudostem made of tightly packed leaf sheaths. In the Philippines, it is a versatile staple: the fruit is eaten raw or cooked (Saba), the heart (Puso ng Saging) is used in salads, and the large, waxy leaves are used as natural, aromatic food wrappers.

18. ![Corchorus_olitorius_65](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ea6b48-2c64-4ea3-b122-41b39a881607)

1. How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy?

With your counts ranging from 177 (Onion/Saging) to 250 (Ampalaya), your dataset is relatively balanced. However, the classes with fewer images (like Onion) might show slightly lower confidence scores compared to Ampalaya. In Teachable Machine, a lack of variety (different angles, lighting, or backgrounds) usually hurts accuracy more than a small difference in the total count.

 2. Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?

The most common "confusion pairs" in your list are likely:

 Sitaw vs. Sigarilyas vs. Patola: Because these are all long, green, pod-like structures, the model might struggle with the specific texture of the "wings" on Sigarilyas versus the "ridges" on Patola.
 Kangkong vs. Kamote: Both are creeping vines with similar green leaf shapes. If the background (soil/garden) is similar, the model might focus on the environment rather than the leaf venation.
 Pechay vs. Mustard (if added): The broad green leaves look very similar under different lighting.

 3. How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?

Since Teachable Machine is "Transfer Learning," these settings behave as follows:

 Epochs: If you noticed the accuracy "jumping" or not settling, you likely increased epochs. Too many (e.g., 100+) on a small dataset can lead to overfitting, where it memorizes your specific photos but fails on new ones.
 Batch Size: Smaller batches (e.g., 16) usually help the model learn more detail but take longer. Larger batches (e.g., 64) are faster but can make the learning "blunt."
 Learning Rate: If set too high (e.g., 0.01), your model might have struggled to "find" the patterns, resulting in fluctuating accuracy.

 4. What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?

 Visual Similarity: Distinguishing between different types of "green leaves" (like Saluyot vs. Malunggay) requires very clear, close-up shots.
 Background Noise: If all your Alugbati photos were taken on a wooden table and all Ampalaya on a white floor, the model might learn to recognize the table/floor instead of the plant.
 Labeling Consistency: Ensuring that "Saging" refers only to the fruit or also includes the leaf/heart can confuse the model if not labeled strictly.

 5. If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?

 Data Augmentation: I would add photos of the plants in different states (sliced vs. whole, cooked vs. raw, or under different lighting).
 Background Diversity: Taking photos of the vegetables in a kitchen, a garden, and a market setting would make the model more "robust" (capable of working in the real world).
 Increase Samples for "Low" Classes: I would bring Onion and Saging up to 250 to match Ampalaya, ensuring the model doesn't develop a bias toward the classes with more data.
